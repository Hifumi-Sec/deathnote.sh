# deathnote.sh
Today is the day where you can choose to do something. Will you take the potato chip and eat it? Or will the bag stay closed?

## Usage
```
chmod +x deathnote.sh
```
```
./deathnote.sh
```

## What is this?
This script will display your current working directory and then give you the option to delete any file or directory in that location.

If you would like to take this a step further, feel free to set an alias for "deathnote" and have it run this script everytime so it's more immersive.
