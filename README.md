# Deathnote (deathnote.sh)
Today is the day when you can choose to do something. Will you take the potato chip and eat it? Or will the bag stay closed?

## Usage
Make sure the shell script is given executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x deathnote.sh
```

Run the script:

```bash
./deathnote.sh
```

## What is this?

This script will display your current working directory and then give you the option to delete any file or directory in that location based on a numerical choice.

If you would like to take this a step further, feel free to set an alias for "deathnote" and have it run this script every time you want to delete something.

Example:
```bash
alias deathnote='~/Downloads/deathnote.sh'
```
